PatchOperations are a way of modifying Defs from the vanilla game, DLCs, or even other mods in a safe and interoperable manner. This can be used to rebalance or adjust vanilla content, remove or disable unwanted content, or provide optional changes or content for better mod compatibility. Please see the PatchOperations guide (https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/PatchOperations) for more information.
