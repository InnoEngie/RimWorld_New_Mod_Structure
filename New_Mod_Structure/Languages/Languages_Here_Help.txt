Localization is the process of creating and translating game and mod language content for different languages. This includes both translations for Defs and code-referenced text as well as word list for procedural name and content generation. Please see the localization guide (https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Localization) for more information about the Languages folder and its subfolders.
