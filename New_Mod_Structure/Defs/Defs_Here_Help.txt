XML Definitions or Defs are the primary content definition and configuration source for RimWorld. These Defs define everything from items and plants and animals to faction types and ideoligion options, and as a general rule any mod that adds additional content for RimWorld will likely be adding one or more Defs. Please see the Def guide (https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Defs) for more detailed information.

Subfolders and even file names within the Defs does not matter as all XML files are read into memory from each individual mod and you can freely name them however you want for your own personal organization, however it is recommended that you follow vanilla conventions (SoundDefs in the /SoundDefs folder, ThingDefs in the various /ThingDef_*** folders) for readability. The one exception to this is if you are using versioned LoadFolders.xml entries: XML files with the same resolved path will overwrite each other, with the last one to be loaded taking precedence.
