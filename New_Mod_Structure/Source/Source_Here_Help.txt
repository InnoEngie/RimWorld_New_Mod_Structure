Some mods contain a Source folder containing the source code for their compiled assemblies. This is not read by RimWorld in any way but can be included if you wish to share the source code for your assemblies, but it is strongly recommended that you use a public code repository such as GitHub instead as it's easier to read at a glance and shows changes over time that can help diagnose issues and bugs.
